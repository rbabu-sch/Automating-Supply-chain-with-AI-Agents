# Automating Procurement Supply Chain with AI Agents

## Overview

In this repository, we explore how to leverage AI agents to automate various aspects of the procurement supply chain, making the entire process more efficient and responsive. The aim is to streamline procurement processes, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance supplier relationships through intelligent automation. We use modern AI technologies such as NLP, LLMs, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to automate tasks like supplier onboarding, RFQ (Request for Quotation) processing, purchase order management, and vendor communication.

## Features

- **Supplier Onboarding Automation**: Use NLP-powered AI agents to automate the onboarding process, extracting and validating supplier data from documents and performing compliance checks.

- **Intelligent RFQ Handling**: AI agents automate the generation and management of RFQs, leveraging RAG models to create RFQ documents, engage with suppliers, and gather quotes.

- **Vendor Communication**: Automate communication with vendors through conversational AI chatbots, providing a seamless interface for answering queries, issuing updates, and managing negotiations.

- **Purchase Order Management**: Use AI to manage purchase orders, automate approval workflows, and track order statuses, minimizing manual intervention.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Implement LLM-based AI to analyze procurement data, generate insights, and provide recommendations for optimizing supply chain decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For extracting data from supplier documents and automating communication.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: To handle complex, context-aware conversations with suppliers and generate procurement documents.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Used for generating context-rich responses and retrieving relevant data for procurement tasks.
- **Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch**: For building and deploying AI models.
- **Microsoft Fabric, Azure, AWS**: Cloud platforms for hosting and managing the AI agents.
- **MongoDB, PostgreSQL**: Database solutions for managing procurement data and documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: This project requires Python to run the backend services.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Cloud Account**: Access to Azure, AWS, or Microsoft Fabric for deployment.
- **Database Setup**: MongoDB and PostgreSQL instances set up for managing procurement and vendor data.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/procurement-ai-agents.git
   cd procurement-ai-agents
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Configure your cloud credentials, database URIs, and any required API keys in an `.env` file.

4. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Usage

- Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the procurement chatbot.
- Use the API endpoints to automate RFQ generation, supplier onboarding, and communication workflows.
